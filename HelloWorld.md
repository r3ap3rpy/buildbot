### The hello world build

This is a built in demo from the framework itself.

In order to successfully build on both windows and linux workers we need to make sure the PATH variable holds the path for the **git** command itself.

If you install git after the worker was started you need to shutdown the worker and open a new console which re-reads the PATH values and start the worker.
